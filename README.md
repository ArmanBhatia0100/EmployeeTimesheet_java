# Employee Timesheet Management System

## üìå Project Overview
The **Employee Timesheet Management System** is a robust Java-based application designed for organizations to manage employee work hours efficiently. It enables employees to log their time, managers to review and approve timesheets, and administrators to oversee the entire process. The system ensures accurate tracking, approval workflows, and historical data retention.

## üöÄ Key Features
### Employee Management
- Add new employees with unique employee IDs.
- Update employee details such as name, department, and role.
- Remove employees who are no longer part of the organization.

### Timesheet Management
- Employees can log daily work hours, specify project details, and add remarks.
- Timesheets can be submitted weekly or bi-weekly for review.
- Employees can view and track their past timesheets.
- Request modifications to logged work hours.

### Manager Review & Approval
- Managers can review submitted timesheets.
- Approve or reject timesheets with feedback.
- Modify employee timesheets if necessary.
- Track the approval history of timesheets.

### Authentication & Authorization
- Secure login using **Spring Security and JWT authentication**.
- Role-based access control (RBAC) for Employees, Managers, and Admins.
- Password encryption using **BCrypt**.
- API token expiration and refresh mechanisms.

### Database & Data Management
- **MySQL database** integration for secure and efficient data storage.
- Hibernate ORM for database transactions.
- Automated schema generation and validation.
- Audit logs for timesheet modifications.

## üõ†Ô∏è Technology Stack
- **Backend**: Java 17, Spring Boot 3.0, Hibernate, Spring Security, JWT
- **Database**: MySQL with Hibernate ORM
- **API**: RESTful API with Swagger documentation
- **Frontend (Optional)**: React.js for user interaction
- **Build Tool**: Maven

## üì• Setup Instructions
### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/employee-timesheet-system.git
cd employee-timesheet-system
```

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Database Configuration
Ensure MySQL is installed and running. Create the database:
```sql
CREATE DATABASE timesheet_db;
```
Update the `application.properties` file with correct database credentials:
```properties
spring.datasource.url=jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/timesheet_db
spring.datasource.username=root
spring.datasource.password=yourpassword
spring.jpa.hibernate.ddl-auto=update
```

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Running the Application
```bash
mvn clean install
mvn spring-boot:run
```
